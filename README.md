# Virtual-Attendence-System

# Problem Statement - The current manual attendence system are plagued by inefficiencies, incaccurate data and lack of transparency, leading to disputes, with the size of remote work, traditional attendence system became inadequete. Hence, there is a pressing need for an automated, accurate and transparent virtual attendence system.

# Problem Definition - In this experiment (Practical 1), we will learn how to identify functional and non-functional requirements from the above problem statement. Functional and non-functional requirements are the primary componenets, that help us define the problem more accurately and estimate the cost for the project. This is a basic step in Software Engineering and Project Management.
